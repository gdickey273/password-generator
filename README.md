# Password Generator 
A program designed to prompt user for criteria and print a randomly generated password to the screen based on that criteria.

## User Experience
Upon navigating to the Password Generator page, the user can click on the "Generate Password" to begin the process. The user will then be asked (through 'confirm' windows) how long the password should be (only an answer between 8 and 128 will be accepted and the user cannot continue the process without giving such an answer), whether the password should include lower case letters, upper case letters, numerical characters, or special characters. A randomly generated password meeting the selected criteria is then printed to the text box above the "Generate Password" button.
